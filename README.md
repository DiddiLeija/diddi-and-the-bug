# Diddi and the Bugs

My Game Off 2021 game.

## Introduction

> The Earth is under invasion. A fleet of giant bugs, bacteria, and viruses are
> outside of the planet.
>
> In the meantime, Diddi was developing a secret spacecraft. When his frineds told him of
> the invasion, he decided to visit the brilliant Dr. Chuck (a scientist, and also
> an old friend of Diddi). The doctor gave him the **L1-F3** experimental serum, that kills anything
> alive. That should destroy those bugs...
>
> To ensure that those bugs will be destroyed, Diddi modified his spacecraft to convert it into a
> starfighter that energizes the serum and shoot it. Then, he named the starfighter **Willpower**.
> Suddendly, the Willpower goes outside of the planet, to start the fight...

## How to win

Use the energized serum to destroy **200 bugs** and win! In the meantime, you can earn extra points
by destroying space trash. **Try to get all the points as you can!**

## Game engine

I am planning to build this game using [Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel). I will upload the complete code,
assets and other useful stuff on this repo.
