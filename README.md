# Diddi and the Bug

My Game Off 2021 game.

## Introduction

> Diddi is having fun, fighting enemies across the galaxy. He has created
> a robot to help him, named _The Green Metal Star_ (or just _The Star_). It has several functions to
> be invincible.
>
> But one day, when Diddi was fighting a mercenary with _The Star_, the bot attacked Diddi! Its
> creator was very confused. The bot just flied away...
> While Diddi was hiding at home from his own creation, he read the entire source code of the
> new menace. He found a bug! There is no option: that droid should be destroyed.
>
> Help Diddi to defeat this buggy machine!

## Game engine

I am planning to build this game using [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/). I will upload the complete code,
assets and other useful stuff on this repo.
